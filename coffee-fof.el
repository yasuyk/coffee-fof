;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Introduction:
;;
;; A coffee-mode configuration for `ff-find-other-file'.
;;
;; * You can find the CoffeeScript or JavaScript file corresponding to
;;   this file.
;; * You can find the CoffeeScrpt/JavaScript or test/spec file
;;   corresponding to this file.
;;
;;
;; Requirements:
;;
;; * `coffee-mode'
;; * `js-mode', `js2-mode' or `js3-mode'
;;
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;; * coffee-find-other-file: `C-c f'
;;
;;   Find the CoffeeScript or JavaScript file corresponding to this
;;   file.  This command is enabled in `coffee-mode', `js-mode',
;;   `js2-mode', `js3-mode'.
;;
;; * coffee-find-test-file: `C-c s'
;;
;;   Find the CoffeeScript/JavaScript or test/spec file corresponding
;;   to this file.  This command is enabled in `coffee-mode`,
;;   `js-mode`, `js2-mode`, `js3-mode`.
;;
;;
;; Configuration:
;;
;; Add the following to your Emacs init file:
;;
;;     (require 'coffee-fof) ;; Not necessary if using ELPA package
;;     (coffee-fof-setup)
;;
;; If the .coffee files and .js files are in the same directory, a
;; configuration is not necessary as default value of
;; coffee-fof-search-directories is '(".").
;;
;; If the .coffee and .js files are in different directories, for
;; example, .js files are in `js` directory and .coffee files are in
;; `coffee` directory as below, customize
;; `coffee-fof-search-directories`.
;;

;;
;;
;;     (custom-set-variables
;;      '(coffee-fof-search-directories
;;       '("." "../*")))
;;
;; If you want to set another key binding, configure as follow.
;;
;;     (coffee-fof-setup :other-key "C-c C-f" :test-key "C-c t")
